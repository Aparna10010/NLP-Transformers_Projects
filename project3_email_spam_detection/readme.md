
# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Detection App

A complete web application to detect whether an email message is spam or not. This project combines:

- âœ… Traditional Machine Learning (Logistic Regression + Naive Bayes + TF-IDF)
- âœ… Zero-Shot Transformers (BART Model)

Both approaches are integrated into a single Streamlit app for a smooth user experience.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Highlights

- *Two Detection Methods*:  
  â†’ ML Model: Trained on a labeled dataset using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes.  
  â†’ Zero-Shot Learning: Uses BART-large-mnli from Hugging Face Transformers to predict spam or ham without custom training.

- *User-Friendly Interface*:  
  Simple web interface using Streamlit to input text, select a model, and view prediction results instantly.

- *Deployable Anywhere*:  
  Tested with Streamlit Cloud and local deployment.

ðŸ’¡ Notes

Ensure all .pkl model files are present in the same directory as app.py.

Zero-Shot model may take longer to predict as it loads from Hugging Face Hub.
