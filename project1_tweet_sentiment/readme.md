# 💬 Tweet Sentiment Analyzer with Transformers

This mini app lets you *analyze the sentiment of any tweet or short text* using Hugging Face's Transformers — all wrapped in a clean Streamlit web app!

---

## 🔍 What It Does

You can type or paste any tweet, and this app will tell you whether the sentiment is:
- ✅ *Positive*
- ⚠ *Neutral*
- ❌ *Negative*

Behind the scenes, it's powered by the distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english model.
